My boyfriend had never seen the movie before, and so I decided to put it on. There's a scene very early in the movie where the Devil (played by Elizabeth Hurley) is trying to sell her pitch to get Elliot (Brendan Fraser) to give her his soul. She says, "How would you like to make one simple decision that'll change your life forever?" And Elliot's response is, "Okay, I'm glad Scientology works for you." I couldn't believe it. I hadn't even heard of Scientology back then, but now, everyone knows. –û—Å–ª–µ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∂–µ–ª–∞–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ (2000) ‚Äî Bedazzled. –í—Å—ë –æ —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º–µ: –¥–∞—Ç–∞ –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∞, —Ç—Ä–µ–π–ª–µ—Ä—ã, —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ, –∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä—ã. –û—Ç–∑—ã–≤—ã –∑—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–µ—Ü–µ–Ω–∑–∏–∏. –†–µ–π—Ç–∏–Ω–≥. music (http://picosong.com/vdpS). 
Watching "Bedazzled," I was reminded of the ancient newspaper legend about the reporter sent to cover the Johnstown Flood.

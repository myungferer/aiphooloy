Hey guys, welcome to yet another week of my great OAV watch. This is my little project of watching all the OAVs on my PTW list.all 170+ of them. Sorry for the lack of a post last week I've been super busy and super ill so just hadn't finished anything. - Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki ( https://myanimelist.net/anime/539/Tenchi_Muyou_Ryououki) (1992-1993: AIC) 6/6 eps. Staff and Background This OAV series was an original franchise created with the aim of promoting Pioneer’s new laserdisc. Скачать порно через торрент - Русский институт.

Yes, I'm an horrible person and I apologize. The thing is, when looking for recommendations for anime with fanservice, the vast majority of them are either harem or have a male lead where the women are mostly "accessories". I despite both those things, yet the results I find are things like Seikirei, Qwazer, Freezing, ect. Or the show revol. Instead of singing love songs, give it to me! / Love Me! — The Princess of the Boy High School and the Prince of the Girl High School / Вместо того, чтобы петь песни о любви, подари ее мне.

So CrunchyRoll had a deal where you get 30 random disks for  (came to 30 after tax) so I thought "what the hell  per disk what do I have to lose?" So out of all the disks I received (it was 30 disks total not 30 cases) which ones should I watch? Now for all of these I did not receive the full series, I just got a volume or 2. Normally though I raise the black flag so you can guess how I'll fill in the blanks so don't feel discouraged to recommend It if I should watch Got a few of the ones everyone's getting, but also a few I haven't seen anyone get yet: Lain Vol 1 Gun Sword Vol 1 and 4 Gad Guard Vol 1 and 2 Law of Ueki Vol 1 and 2 Submarine 707 Revolution Last Exile Vol 1 Human Crossing: The 23rd Hour Armitage: Dual-Matrix that Appleseed move everyone is getting Shonen Onmyouji Vol 2 Burn-Up Scramble Vol 1 Viewtiful Joe Vol 2 Best Student Council Vol 2 Saiyuki Reload Gunlock Vol 6 The Daichis Vol 1 Tenjho Tenge Vol 6 Hades. I got some random manga and anime DVD's a few months back, and am now looking to get rid of them. I've only opened one manga so far, and most of the DVD's are still in plastic. I've got 2 copies of each manga listed. I'm looking for  for each manga,  for each DVD unless noted differently, but I have no clue what they're worth (if anything). PM to bargain, or for pics. Manga: Momo Tama volumes 1, 3, and 4 Dragon Hunter volume 11 Priest volume 3 Faeries' Landing volume. I've never seen ANY of these, so at least that's a start.

Background The story I want to tell you is full of sadness and heartache. I started out life in poverty living with my parents in a house that had some wooden floors and mostly dirt floors. My mother has a long list of mental issues and my father was an alcoholic and thankfully not the abusive type. Me and my sister were taken from our home when I was 7 and she was 4. We got placed into the foster care system in Kentucky. I'm not going to use real names, but I will use the initials. A/N: Here is the battle that I had planned for Episode 5, and I got it all in one episode! } : = 8 D In today’s episode, tricksy elves, and Rinn shows his worth. Edit for typos.

Hello everyone! Ever since Priest of the Forgotten Gods was spoiled in the last set, I have been trying to make her work. Thus far, that has been done from a Mardu perspective. This was because I believed Judith to be an essential element to making any aristocrat type deck work. After a lot of testing, I can now definitively say I was wrong about that. Even with the new cards in WAR, I do not think the Mardu Aristocrats holds up. That said, I believe that there is a tiered deck that uses Priest. gtbe me; Old LizarDM gtbe not me; human ranger (Finn), human monk (Reyna), shifter druid (Camila), half orc fighter (Devin), genasi warlock (Werhan), warforged bard (Be Bop), spellscale sorcerer (Suryn) gtthe warlock’s eyes snap open and he lets out a long gasp before he collapses and falls to the sand gtKetan withdraws his trident and turns, striking the sorcerer across the face gtthe monk swings her quarterstaff into his head, and Ketan’s limbs lock as his body is stunned. First (https://redd.it/bg40e9) Previous (https://redd.it/bhlojr) --- Too bad I didn’t save anything for the run back. We trot back to the gate at half normal speed, weapons raised, slowly clearing angles with needleguns in hand and maskers on our backs. My legs burn. That’s fine – the only Tongues nearby are missing a few key chunks of flesh. “So you let me win.” It’s almost more embarrassing for her than if I’d actually won. “Wasn’t acting.” I mumble. “I don’t believe you.”.

Previous: Inside Underground NY Poker #5 (https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/bez6o2/inside_underground_ny_poker_5/) amp#x200B; Spades — 1.5 Do you know what it feels like to be the last man standing in a live tournament? Sure, scooping a 600 big blind pot in a cash game will probably give you an adrenaline rush, but the experience isn’t quite the same as outlasting an entire field of players. I wanted to experience that feeling for myself. The reentry period in the  tournament. Okay, this happened Wednesday. I (f 14) am still shaken up. We (my family and I) were coming home from a wonderful day, when there is a side road that cars were pulling out of. One car pulls out, a bit close, but safe none the less. So we assume the second car will have the sense NOT to pull out. Were we correct? No, we weren't. The second car pulls out (SO IDIOTICALLY) and my mum who was going UNDER 30 mph tried to brake, then after half a second realised this was not going to work and swerved. I’ve been blind for a year now. Long story short, my ex-boyfriend thought it would be funny to burn me with acid. He was pissed I’d broken up with him after he tried to slap me. The last thing I ever saw was him running up to me holding a multicolored can of some sort of cleaning chemical, a wild look in his eyes and a twisted grin on his face. Still turns my stomach to think about it. After about a week in the hospital, I was sent home, my eyes permanently clouded and my face scarred, complete. Took some time to write my guesses/thoughts/theories as to what happens for the rest of the season. Poke holes in it, and let me know what you think! (sorry for how long it is) Theory from Episode 3 on: The Night King’s army attacks Winterfell, however, the Night King is not seen. The wights attack on the surface in a battle with Jamie, the Hound, Tourmond, Brienne, Pod, Edd, Grey Worm, and the Unsullied/Dothraki takes place. Jon and Danny mount the dragons and go after the Night Kings. 
After some minor but lovely support on my last post I decided to go for another one this time in the Quality of life department . The last patch gave us some great changes such as the starting location map in the menu and mods warning when loading a save but the work is not done. Take a cup of coffee / tea and get yourself ready for a reading session as this will be a bit long \^\_\^^(.) \ \ The changes I suggest below are improvements and not creation from scratch Don't know if this has been posted already. I often find myself loading into a Gambit Prime after I've been doing Crucible or Strikes or some other type of gameplay. I still have my "Crucible gear" on (Wormhusk Crown, 7 resiliency armor and boots with Traction, and gear centered around Handcannons, ie Enhanced Hand Cannon Targeting, Unflinching Handcannon Aim, etc.). So I find myself scrambling to find my Invader Set and switch my weapon loadout. I also need to switch Trees which I sometimes.

My mother has a long list of mental issues and my father was an alcoholic and thankfully not the abusive type. Me and my sister were taken Hey r/EDH folks! You might remember the last post I made here a bit over a month ago discussing my budget Izoni and talking about how the first Commander League night went with it. Well, I (and all my buggo friends) are back for another one. Right on time. (https://imgur.com/tfjBChZ) Jokes aside, I've been dealing with some significant personal issues that have kept me from comfortably attending my LGS' League nights. I'm fine now, though, and I'm definitely ready to get back to jamming. gtbe me; LizarDM gtbe not me; lizardfolk fighter, lizardfolk cleric, lizardfolk paladin, drow rogue and kobold bard gtthe party, having returned to the swamp and released Black Tooth from his underground prison, are now preparing to set off on their journey to lure the Forged God to the swamp gtthe paladin looks up at Black Tooth as the dragon stretches his wings gthis muscles are atrophied, and his wings look sinewy, but his sheer size grants him a presence of power unmatched. </p>
